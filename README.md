# aJynks Level Info Mod

### G'day! Jynks here.

This is my **first ever mod**. I created it as a way to get some grounding in **zScripting** as part of my modding journey. I'm pretty happy with it! It's simple, but I think it's something I will actually use myself, so maybe others will like it too.

The main goal was just to explore **zScript** and get an idea of how it all works.

## Features

### Main Features

- **Level Info Display**:  
  Displays the following level info on the screen:
  - **Time played on the map (H:M:S:Tics)**  
    - If there's no hour value, it's omitted.
    - GZDoom uses **35 tics per second**, but I converted that to **60 tics per second** for a cooler look.
  
- **Custom Font**:  
  - A new font from daFonts, made in **GZDoom's Unicode format**.

- **Menu Config System**:  
  - Move the widget anywhere on the screen.
  - Display the info text on a **single line**.
  - Scale the widget.
  - Switch between my custom font and Doom's default fonts.
  - Change the **color** of different text elements (requested feature).
  - Toggle visibility of **total Kills, Items, and Secrets**.
  - **Custom Name Tag** widget (perfect for YouTubers).
  - Toggle display of **map name and map slot** (fully configurable).

- **Bonus Feature**:  
  - Added an alias to toggle **auto-run on/off** without showing a console message.

**Note:** This mod is designed for **GZDoom only**.

A special shoutout to **dsda-Doom** for inspiring me. This mod is a **100% rip-off** of their UI, but I couldn't find anything similar for GZDoom.  
I hope they're not upsetâ€”I used **no data from dsda-Doom**, just inspiration.

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning!  
I have some programming experience, so making a small **ZScript mod** seemed like an easier way to start modding rather than diving into **map editors**. But **mapping is definitely next**!

Thanks for checking out my mod!
